# ZenvaTurnBase
Class Game

This was my first time attempting to create a turn based game and it was extremely fun. This game has a simple gameplay loop of the enemy being in front of the player
and the player having multiple options and moves to defeat the enemy. What I learned the most during this class was creating an Enum where it allows things to be in
certain states, this is how the system determines who turn it is to attack; based on the current state of the game as well as the turn manager. Additionally I learned a 
very basic AI system using an  animation curve, where the Enemy is more likely to heal the lower HP it is based on the curve.
